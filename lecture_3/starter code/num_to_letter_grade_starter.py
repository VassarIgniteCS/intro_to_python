# write a function that takes in a numeric grade
# and then returns its corresponding letter grade

# assume that all numeric grades are between [0, 100]
# and that letter grades are the traditional A, B, C, D, and F
def num_to_letter_grade(num_grade):
  # if this expression is true return "A"

  # if this expression is true return "B"

  # if this expression is true return "C"

  # if this expression is true return "D"

  # else return "F"

# HINT: use control flow statements as discussed in lecture 1
