# write a function that takes in a triangle's base and height
# and then returns the area of that triangle

# triangle_area
# given a triangle's base and height, will return the area of said triangle
def triangle_area(b, h) :
    # now we just need to return the area of the triangle
    # NOTE: the area of a triangle is equal to the (base * height) / 2

# now try to test out the function on different types of input by making
# multiple function calls
