Lecture 2 Activities
====================
Abstracting a Function
----------------------
Turn code from prior lecture and write them as functions
take an example program and remove the repeated code by defining a 
function

Multiple Parameters
-------------------
Write a function that takes in a string and a number and returns string 
repeated that many times (multiplied by that number)

Import the math and random package 
----------------------------------
Implement a function that returns the hypotenuse of a triangle (length 
of the other two sides are the arguments for the function)
