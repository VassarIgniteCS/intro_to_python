# we start by defining a function called "rev"
#   (reverse is already the name of a function, so we can't use that!)

# this is going to be the exact code from the first challenge in the last lecture!
# instead of using input() to get the variables, we input them to the function as parameters
def rev(string):
    
    # what goes here????

    # instead of printing the result to the console with print(), we return the string
    # so that we can use it in the code we are calling the function from
    return reversed_string

# now we can use this function to implement the second challenge from last lecture, checking
# if a word is a palindrome
