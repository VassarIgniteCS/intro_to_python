#   PALINDROME
#   CHALLENGE: input a string, and print whether it is a palindrome or not

# the beginning of this program will look an awful lot like the previous one!
# we want to input a string and store the reverse of it as a variable.

# if a string is a palindrome, the reverse of the string will equal the string!
# replace the question marks with the appropriate values 

if ? == ?:
    print("") # what do we know is true if we're in this branch?
else:
    print("") # what else do we know if we're here?
