#   STRING REVERSE
#   CHALLENGE: input a string, and print the reverse of that string
#       if you try to run this without filling in some code, it won't work!
#        read the comments if you need help

# we need a string to reverse, so let's use this line to input a string and store it in a variable.
to_reverse = 

# we also need an index variable to keep track of where we are in the string
# when we're in the loop. where should it start?
# there are multiple correct ways to do this!
index = 

# we will likely also need a variable to store the reversed string in,
# which we can just set to be empty to start
reversed_string = 


# we will definitely need a while loop. what is the condition here?
# we want to stay in the while loop until we've zgone through the whole string,
# what are we using to keep track of that? and how do we know when we are done?
# replace condition with the correct expression
while condition:
    # for each iteration of the loop, we want to take the an item from 
    # string and append it (with the + operator) to reversed_string 
    reversed_string =
    
    # we need to change the index at each loop so that at some point,
    # the condition is no longer true, and we can continue with the program
    # how we change it depends on how we defined our condition!
    index =
    
    
# print the result!
print(reversed_string)
