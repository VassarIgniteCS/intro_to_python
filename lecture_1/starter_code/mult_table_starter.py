#   MULTIPLICATION TABLE
#   CHALLENGE: print out a multiplication table

# let's use a variable to determine how large our table is


# since our multiplication table is a two dimensional table, we will need two loops
# to print it out, and two index variables

i = 0
while condition:
    
    n = 0
    while condition:
        # what do we want to print here? 
        #   (print has another input called end which gets set to '\n' by default,
        #   so print normally adds a new line, but we don't want that, so we set end
        #   to be an empty string!)
        print(???, end='')
        
        # we need to change the inner index variable somehow...
        n =
    # now, just to make it look nice, we want to print a new line
    print()
    # we also need to change our other index variable
    i =
